# Research Context

This project explores an open question in human-AI collaboration: **how can LLM-based agents interact with professional financial desktop applications to support human decision-making?**

## Motivation

Agent-augmented trading represents an emerging paradigm where LLM agents assist — but do not replace — human traders. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools. Financial desktop applications like TradingView are among the most complex, stateful, real-time interfaces that exist. Connecting the two raises genuine research questions about agent reliability, context management, and human-AI collaboration that remain under-explored.

This project is not a trading bot. It is an **interface layer** that makes a trading application legible to an LLM agent, allowing researchers and developers to study human-AI collaboration in financial workflows.

## Research Questions

### 1. Context Window Constraints

A full chart state with multiple indicators can easily exceed practical context limits. A single Pine Script source file can be 200KB+. OHLCV data for 500 bars approaches 40KB.

**How should agents prioritize what to read?** This project's approach: compact-by-default output (`summary: true`, deduplicated pine graphics, capped labels), with verbose mode as opt-in. The tool design itself encodes a hypothesis about agent-friendly data granularity.

**Key finding:** The most impactful design decision was making all tools return compact output by default. Without this, a typical "analyze my chart" workflow consumes 80KB+ of context. With compact defaults, it's 5-10KB.

### 2. Temporal Consistency

Market data changes continuously. A quote fetched at the start of an agent's reasoning may be stale by the time it responds. Indicator values shift every tick.

**How does an agent reason about data that may be stale by the time it processes it?** What's the practical latency budget for chart-reading workflows?

**Key finding:** When streaming data changes faster than the agent can respond, the agent's reasoning becomes stale. This is a fundamental limitation of request-response LLM architectures operating on real-time data. The practical solution is using streaming for human monitoring (piped to dashboards) rather than agent consumption.

### 3. Tool Granularity

Should an agent have one `read_chart` tool or 78 granular tools? This project chose granularity — separate tools for quote, OHLCV, indicator values, pine lines, pine labels, pine tables, pine boxes, etc.

**The tradeoff:** Granular tools give the agent precise control and small payloads, but require the agent to know which tool to call (solved via MCP server instructions and a decision-tree config file). A single coarse tool would be simpler but would waste context on unneeded data.

**Key finding:** 78 tools does not confuse the agent. With descriptive tool names and clear instructions, Claude consistently selects the right tools. The key is the instruction block — not reducing tool count.

### 4. Failure Transparency

When an agent misreads a chart — interpreting a label incorrectly, reading stale data, or misunderstanding indicator values — how should it communicate uncertainty?

This project surfaces raw data and lets the agent reason about it, rather than pre-interpreting. This means failures are visible in the agent's reasoning trace rather than hidden behind an abstraction.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Design

What decisions should always require explicit human confirmation? Currently, all chart mutations (symbol changes, indicator additions, drawing) are executed immediately. Replay trading is simulated only.

The boundary between "agent acts autonomously" and "agent proposes, human confirms" is a design decision with implications for both usability and safety.

### 6. Multi-Asset Agent Reasoning

When an agent monitors multiple symbols simultaneously (via multi-pane layouts + streaming), how does it reason about cross-asset relationships? Can it identify divergences, correlations, or relative strength from raw OHLCV across 4 panes?

### 7. Pine Script as Agent Output

Can an LLM agent write, debug, and iterate on Pine Script effectively? Pine Script is a domain-specific language with unusual constraints (series types, historical referencing, repainting behavior).

**Key finding:** The compile → error → fix loop is where agent assistance provides the most value. Pine Script has unusual semantics that even experienced programmers struggle with. Having an agent that can read errors, understand the language, and propose fixes significantly accelerates development.

## Findings Summary

| Area | Finding |
|------|---------|
| Context management | Compact-by-default outputs reduced workflow context from 80KB to 5-10KB |
| Tool count | 78 tools is manageable with clear naming and instructions |
| Pine Script development | Strongest use case — compile-error-fix loop accelerates iteration |
| Real-time data | Streaming is better for human monitoring than agent consumption |
| Agent reliability | Varies significantly by model and context length |
| Conditional order responses | Binance algo order endpoints return `algoId`/`algoStatus` not `orderId`/`status` — tool must handle both response shapes |

### 8. Conditional Order API Divergence

Binance Futures uses separate REST endpoints for regular orders (`/fapi/v1/order`) and conditional/stop orders (`/fapi/v1/algoOrder`). These endpoints return structurally different response payloads — regular orders return `orderId`/`status`, while conditional orders return `algoId`/`algoStatus`.

**Key finding:** The `binance-api-node` library routes all order types through a single `futuresOrder()` method but the response shape depends on the order type. Initial tool code only extracted `orderId` and `status`, making conditional orders appear to fail when they actually succeeded. This is a classic API abstraction leak.

**Fix applied:** Updated `place_futures_order` to check for both `orderId` and `algoId`, both `status` and `algoStatus`, and both `stopPrice` and `triggerPrice`. Successful conditional orders now properly report their `algoId` and `algoStatus: "NEW"`.

### 9. Conditional Order Visibility

Binance does not expose a GET endpoint to list open conditional/algo orders. The `GET /fapi/v1/algoOpenOrders` returns 404. Only account-level position data and unconditional `GET /fapi/v1/openOrders` are available.

This means **conditional stop/tp orders cannot be programmatically verified** after placement using standard Binance REST API. The only way to confirm they exist is through the TradingView UI or Binance web interface.

**Workaround:** Cancel all orders before re-placing to ensure clean state.

## Limitations

- Depends on undocumented internal TradingView APIs that change without notice
- Binance conditional orders (SL/TP) cannot be queried via REST after placement — only cancelled and re-placed
- Not suitable for production automated trading
- Agent performance varies significantly by model and available context length
- Real-time data introduces fundamental latency challenges for LLM reasoning
- No formal evaluation framework — findings are observational
